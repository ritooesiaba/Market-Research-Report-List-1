<p><strong>The Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement (TMVR) Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Functional Mitral Regurgitation (FMR)</li><li>Degenerative Mitral Regurgitation (DMR)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement (TMVR) targets mitral regurgitation, a condition where blood leaks backward into the heart. The market is divided into two primary applications: Functional Mitral Regurgitation (FMR), which arises from altered heart structure due to heart failure or other cardiac conditions, and Degenerative Mitral Regurgitation (DMR), typically resulting from valve degeneration or prolapse. TMVR provides a less invasive option for patients, enhancing outcomes and expanding treatment accessibility for both forms of mitral regurgitation.</p></p>
