<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrosurgical Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopole Electrosurgical Generator</li><li>Bipolar Electrosurgical Generator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electrosurgical generator market is primarily divided into monopolar and bipolar electrosurgical generators. Monopolar electrosurgical generators use a single active electrode to cut and coagulate tissue, with a grounding pad placed on the patient, making them suitable for a variety of surgical procedures. In contrast, bipolar electrosurgical generators employ two electrodes, allowing current to pass only between them, thus minimizing tissue damage and providing precision in delicate surgeries. Both types facilitate effective surgical interventions, enhancing efficiency and safety in operating rooms.</p></p>
