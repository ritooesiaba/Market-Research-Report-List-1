<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Feed Additives for Mycotoxin Detoxification Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adsorbing Agent</li><li>Bio-Transforming Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Feed Additives for Mycotoxin Detoxification market comprises two primary types: adsorbing agents and bio-transforming agents. Adsorbing agents, typically clays or activated charcoal, bind mycotoxins in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing their absorption and mitigating their harmful effects. Bio-transforming agents, on the other hand, utilize biological processes, often involving microbes or enzymes, to degrade mycotoxins into less harmful compounds. Together, these additives enhance animal health and productivity by reducing the toxicity of contaminated feed.</p></p>
