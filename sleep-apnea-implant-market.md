<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sleep Apnea Implant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Neuromodulator Implants</li><li>Tongue Obstruction Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sleep apnea implant market includes two primary types: neuromodulator implants and tongue obstruction implants. Neuromodulator implants stimulate the nerves controlling tongue movement, preventing airway blockage during sleep. They help restore normal breathing patterns by activating muscles when obstructive apnea is detected. Tongue obstruction implants focus on stabilizing the tongue, preventing it from collapsing into the airway. Both types aim to reduce sleep apnea severity and improve patient quality of life by providing non-invasive alternatives to traditional therapies.</p></p>
